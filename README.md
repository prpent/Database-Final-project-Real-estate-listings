Through this project, we will achieve the below-mentioned primary objectives: 

Users will be able to find their preferred home based on multiple search criteria. In addition, we will provide potential home buyers with relevant statistical visualizations to make an informed decision. We used Streamlit with python to design the web page layouts for our application. There will be a total of 5 main pages 
The architecture of the web page is as follows:


1)	All users can read about the application on the home page
2)	Registered users  will be able to login into the application from the home page and can manage the listings.
3)	Admin can add, update, delete and view a record after successful login.
4)	Admin can add a new listing from ‘Add Listings’ page.
5)	Admin can modify/delete the listing from the Update/Delete listing page
6)	Admin can view statistics through visualizations on the statistical plots page.
7)	Users can view all the listings as per the requirement using different filters on the search listings page.
